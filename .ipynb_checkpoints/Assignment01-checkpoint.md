Dear "CE302 Advanced Programming Techniques for Engineers" Class' Students

You are supposed to write a Python Code to generate a random password creator.

This code will perform and check the details below:

1. Your password length will be between 6-15 unit
1.1. There will be numbers (0,1,2, ...,8,9), letters(a, b, c, d, ...., w, x, y, z) and special characters (@, -, *, +, -, /)

2. Your code will check
	- How many characters do you have?
	- Is it sensitive for small-big letters? (iy is expected to be sensitive)
	- Does your code has letters, numbers, and special characters simultaneously? (it is expected to contain all)
	- Does your code consist of sequencing numbers and letters?

3. You'll write for code taking these instructions into account then your code will generate a password.

Please get any kind of collaboration together.
Good luck.
